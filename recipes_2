Classic Potato Salad Recipe
Ingredients:

    2 pounds (about 1 kg) of potatoes (Yukon Gold or red potatoes work well)
    1 cup mayonnaise
    1 tablespoon yellow mustard
    2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
    1 teaspoon sugar
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/2 teaspoon black pepper
    1 cup celery, finely diced
    1/2 cup red onion, finely diced
    1/4 cup dill pickle relish
    4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
    2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped (optional)
    Paprika for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

    Cook the Potatoes:
        Wash the potatoes and place them in a large pot. Cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt.
        Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes.
        Drain and let cool. Once cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes if desired and cut them into bite-sized pieces.

    Prepare the Dressing:
        In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, apple cider vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper until smooth.

    Combine Ingredients:
        Add the diced celery, red onion, dill pickle relish, and chopped hard-boiled eggs to the bowl with the dressing. Stir to combine.
        Gently fold in the potato pieces, being careful not to mash them.

    Chill and Serve:
        Cover the potato salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together.
        Before serving, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Garnish with chopped fresh dill and a sprinkle of paprika if desired.

Homemade Pizza Recipe

Ingredients:

For the dough:

    2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
    1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110째F or 45째C)
    3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    2 teaspoons sugar
    1 teaspoon salt

For the sauce:

    1 cup canned tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    1 teaspoon dried oregano
    1 teaspoon dried basil
    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    Salt and pepper to taste

For the toppings:

    2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
    Fresh basil leaves
    Olive oil for drizzling
    Optional: sliced tomatoes, pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.

Instructions:

    Make the Dough:
        In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.
        In a large bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
        Mix until the dough begins to come together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
        Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

    Prepare the Sauce:
        In a medium bowl, combine the tomato sauce, olive oil, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.

    Assemble the Pizza:
        Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.
        Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal pieces. On a floured surface, roll out each piece into a 12-inch circle.
        If using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out dough to a piece of parchment paper. If using a baking sheet, lightly grease it and transfer the dough directly to the sheet.
        Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
        Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add any additional toppings if desired.
        Drizzle a little olive oil over the top.

    Bake the Pizza:
        If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the parchment paper with the pizza onto the preheated stone. If using a baking sheet, place it in the oven.
        Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Top with fresh basil leaves before slicing and serving.
