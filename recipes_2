Classic Potato Salad Recipe
Ingredients:

    2 pounds (about 1 kg) of potatoes (Yukon Gold or red potatoes work well)
    1 cup mayonnaise
    1 tablespoon yellow mustard
    2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
    1 teaspoon sugar
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/2 teaspoon black pepper
    1 cup celery, finely diced
    1/2 cup red onion, finely diced
    1/4 cup dill pickle relish
    4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
    2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped (optional)
    Paprika for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

    Cook the Potatoes:
        Wash the potatoes and place them in a large pot. Cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt.
        Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes.
        Drain and let cool. Once cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes if desired and cut them into bite-sized pieces.

    Prepare the Dressing:
        In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, apple cider vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper until smooth.

    Combine Ingredients:
        Add the diced celery, red onion, dill pickle relish, and chopped hard-boiled eggs to the bowl with the dressing. Stir to combine.
        Gently fold in the potato pieces, being careful not to mash them.

    Chill and Serve:
        Cover the potato salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together.
        Before serving, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Garnish with chopped fresh dill and a sprinkle of paprika if desired.

Enjoy your delicious homemade potato salad!
