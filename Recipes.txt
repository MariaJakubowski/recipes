1. Fudgy Brownies:

Ingredients:

    1 cup (225g) unsalted butter
    2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
    4 large eggs
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    ¾ cup (90g) unsweetened cocoa powder
    1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
    ½ teaspoon salt
    1 cup (175g) semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional, for extra richness)

Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan, or line it with parchment paper.

Melt the Butter: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.

Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

Add Dry Ingredients: Sift in the cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, and salt into the wet ingredients mixture. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Fold in Chocolate Chips (Optional): If using chocolate chips, gently fold them into the batter until evenly distributed.

Bake: Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs (not wet batter). Remember, you want fudgy brownies, so it's okay if the toothpick isn't completely clean.

Cool and Serve: Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve. Enjoy your fudgy brownies!


2. Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients:

    1 cup (2 sticks or 225g) unsalted butter, softened
    3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
    3/4 cup (150g) packed brown sugar
    2 large eggs
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract

    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate chips

Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

Add Eggs and Vanilla: Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract until well combined.

Mix Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.

Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Add Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Form Cookies: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. You can also use a cookie scoop for uniform cookies.

Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set.

Cool and Serve: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. Enjoy your classic chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk!


3. New York Cheesecake

Ingredients:

For the crust:

    1 1/2 cups (about 150g) graham cracker crumbs
    1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
    1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted

For the filling:

    4 (8 oz each) packages cream cheese, softened
    1 1/4 cups (250g) granulated sugar
    4 large eggs
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    1/4 cup (60ml) sour cream
    1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream

Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan tightly with aluminum foil to prevent water from leaking in during the baking process. This is important if you're planning to use a water bath (which helps prevent cracking).

Make the Crust: In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, creating an even layer. Use the bottom of a glass or a flat object to help press it down evenly.

Bake the Crust: Place the crust in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.

Make the Filling: In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar together until smooth and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract, sour cream, and heavy cream until fully combined and the mixture is smooth.

Pour and Bake: Pour the filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Place the springform pan in a larger roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan (this helps prevent cracking).

Bake the Cheesecake: Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door closed for 1 hour.

Chill the Cheesecake: Remove the cheesecake from the oven and carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen it from the pan. Allow it to cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.

Serve: Once chilled and set, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Slice and serve plain or with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, whipped cream, or chocolate sauce.


4. Lemon Tart:

Ingredients:

For the crust:

    1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
    1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
    1/4 cup granulated sugar
    Pinch of salt
    1 large egg yolk
    1-2 tablespoons ice water, if needed

For the lemon filling:

    4 large eggs
    3/4 cup granulated sugar
    1 tablespoon lemon zest (from about 2 lemons)
    1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 4 lemons)
    1/2 cup heavy cream
    Powdered sugar, for dusting

Instructions:
For the crust:

In a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, and salt until combined.
Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Add the egg yolk and pulse until the dough starts to come together. If the dough is too dry, add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it comes together.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to fit into a 9-inch tart pan. Press the dough into the pan and trim any excess. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork.
Line the crust with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment paper, and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Let cool completely.

For the lemon filling:

    In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until well combined.
    Whisk in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and heavy cream until smooth.
    Pour the filling into the cooled tart crust.
    Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.
    Let the tart cool completely on a wire rack, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
    Dust with powdered sugar before serving.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Lemon Tart!
