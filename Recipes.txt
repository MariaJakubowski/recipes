1. Fudgy Brownies:

Ingredients:

    1 cup (225g) unsalted butter
    2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
    4 large eggs
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    ¾ cup (90g) unsweetened cocoa powder
    1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
    ½ teaspoon salt
    1 cup (175g) semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional, for extra richness)

Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan, or line it with parchment paper.

Melt the Butter: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.

Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

Add Dry Ingredients: Sift in the cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, and salt into the wet ingredients mixture. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Fold in Chocolate Chips (Optional): If using chocolate chips, gently fold them into the batter until evenly distributed.

Bake: Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs (not wet batter). Remember, you want fudgy brownies, so it's okay if the toothpick isn't completely clean.

Cool and Serve: Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve. Enjoy your fudgy brownies!

    3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
    3/4 cup (150g) packed brown sugar
    2 large eggs

    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate chips

Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

Add Eggs and Vanilla: Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract until well combined.

Mix Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.

Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Add Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Form Cookies: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. You can also use a cookie scoop for uniform cookies.

Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set.

Cool and Serve: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. Enjoy your classic chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk!
